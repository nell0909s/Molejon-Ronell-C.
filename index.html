        <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
        <p>Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="function">
        <h2>Function of Cloud Computing</h2>
        <img src="d:\SERENIO NICOLE\birthstone\cloud-computing-4199287-f346729f8f574000a3058b9ad69e9a41.png" alt="" id="image-left" >
        <ol id="olf">
            <li>Servers </li>
                <p>A simple cloud server definition is cloud servers are virtual (not physical) servers running in a cloud computing environment that can be accessed on demand by unlimited users. Cloud servers work just like physical servers and they perform similar functions like storing data and running applications.</p>
            <li>Storage </li>
                <p>Cloud Storage is a mode of computer data storage in which digital data is stored on servers in off-site locations. The servers are maintained by a third-party provider who is responsible for hosting, managing, and securing data stored on its infrastructure.</p>  
            <li>databases </li>
                <p>A cloud database is a database built to run in a public or hybrid cloud environment to help organize, store, and manage data within an organization. Cloud databases can be offered as a managed database-as-a-service (DBaaS) or deployed on a cloud-based virtual machine (VM) and self-managed by an in-house IT team.</p>
            <li> networking </li>
                <p>Cloud networking is virtual network components, topologies, and configurations that run on a cloud provider's physical networking infrastructure. You define and manage your networks as software. You can create your own virtual local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs) with cloud resources.</p>
            <li>software </li>
                <p>Cloud-based software simply refers to any software program or application that's stored, managed, and available through the cloud. To access such services or software programs, users must have an internet connection. It is generally stored on shared computing resources, such as cloud servers.</p>
